# BachChoraleBook
Reimschneider Versions of Bach Chorales with German Words. 

All files are ly (Lilypond) files - So you must have lilypond installed to compile the file.  I will include the PDFs as I create them however.  I will initially be using English as I work through these with my choir but will add the German Words later.  I am considering using a Fraktur/Deutsches Buchstaben font.

Working from two PCs to complete this project as well as, get into git.   

I am going to try to write in both closed and open score settings.
